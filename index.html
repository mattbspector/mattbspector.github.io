					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> 2013 was a career high year for Lesean Mccoy. He set career highs with 314 carries and 1,607 rushing yards. He is also considered a king of the PPR throne, having more than 50 catches in three of the last four seasons. Shady truly benefits from a Chip Kelly run-heavy offense, and a possible 2000 yard season does not seem out of reach. Look for Mccoy to have another impressive season as he rules the one of the many PPR kingdoms.<p>
				</div>
				<div class = "offvert">
				</div>
				<div class = "shouldnot ">
				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>Having a less impressive season than his 2013 season is almost inevitable. It is extremely likely that his Rushing Yards per game will decrease, and his opportunities to catch passes from the backfield might regress as well. The Eagles brought in PPR monster Darren Sproles this offseason, and he is expected to take away some of Mccoy&apos;s reps. However, Sproles should not be the reason you do not draft McCoy. Just look for a slight regression this year compared to his 2013 campaign.</p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> You know what they say? Purple is the color or royalty. You know what they call Peterson? Purple Jesus. Peterson surprised nobody last year, averaging 90 rushing yards a game. Rumor has it that Peterson has been working on his pass-catching skills, and with Gerhart out of the picture, look for Peterson&apos;s PPR value to rise. Norv Turner also plans on using AP in a more creative way, getting him more involved in open space and in the passing the game. Peterson should definitely be looked at as a high end first round pick. </p>

				<div class = "offvert">
				</div>
				<div class = "shouldnot ">
				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>There are many questions surrounding whether or not AP is going to ask to leave the Vikings this year, as he has expressed a good amount of unhappiness with the quarterback situation and may request to take his talents elsewhere. He is also close to turning 30 and past the average age of elite Running Backs. Lastly, look out for his injury risk. His body has certainly taken a toll at this point in his career, and his way of running through people makes him a likely candidate for a possible injury.</p>

					<p> Over the course of the last three years, Graham has hands-down been the best tight end in football. With the departures of Darren Sproles and Lance Moore through free agency, expect Graham to be targeted even more often in the high-powered Saints offense. Last year, he scored the second most touchdowns ever for a tight end.  With more potential targets and a proven history, Jimmy Graham will be a hard to pass up. </p>

				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>In his final five games, including the playoffs, Graham was held to only 2 touchdowns.  While some people attribute it to defenses discovering a way to slow him down, most people believe that Jimmy Graham was actually bothered by a plantar fascia injury.  With what is expected to be an enormous workload this season, let us all hope that the injury bug doesn&apos;t rear its ugly head.</p>
