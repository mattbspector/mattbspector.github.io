					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> 2013 was a career high year for Lesean Mccoy. He set career highs with 314 carries and 1,607 rushing yards. He is also considered a king of the PPR throne, having more than 50 catches in three of the last four seasons. Shady truly benefits from a Chip Kelly run-heavy offense, and a possible 2000 yard season does not seem out of reach. Look for Mccoy to have another impressive season as he rules the one of the many PPR kingdoms.<p>
				</div>
				<div class = "offvert">
				</div>
				<div class = "shouldnot ">
				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>Having a less impressive season than his 2013 season is almost inevitable. It is extremely likely that his Rushing Yards per game will decrease, and his opportunities to catch passes from the backfield might regress as well. The Eagles brought in PPR monster Darren Sproles this offseason, and he is expected to take away some of Mccoy&apos;s reps. However, Sproles should not be the reason you do not draft McCoy. Just look for a slight regression this year compared to his 2013 campaign.</p>

					<p> You know what they say? Purple is the color or royalty. You know what they call Peterson? Purple Jesus. Peterson surprised nobody last year, averaging 90 rushing yards a game. Rumor has it that Peterson has been working on his pass-catching skills, and with Gerhart out of the picture, look for Peterson&apos;s PPR value to rise. Norv Turner also plans on using AP in a more creative way, getting him more involved in open space and in the passing the game. Peterson should definitely be looked at as a high end first round pick. </p>

				<p>There are many questions surrounding whether or not AP is going to ask to leave the Vikings this year, as he has expressed a good amount of unhappiness with the quarterback situation and may request to take his talents elsewhere. He is also close to turning 30 and past the average age of elite Running Backs. Lastly, look out for his injury risk. His body has certainly taken a toll at this point in his career, and his way of running through people makes him a likely candidate for a possible injury.</p>

					<p> There is no better receiver in the NFL. It&apos;s just that simple. He played 14 games last year and still managed to rake in 84 receptions for 1,492 yards and 12 touchdowns.

				<p>There are very few, and I mean VERY few reasons why you shouldn&apos;t take Calvin Johnson. He did have operations performed on his knee and finger, however, multiple reports have claimed that he looks to be at 100%. Also, Scott Linehan has left the Lions to run the Cowboys offense, so there is a chance that the Lions will not throw the pigskin as much. Not to mention, Golden Tate has joined the team and could easily gain Stafford&apos;s trust for when there are too many defensive players hovering around Megatron. </p>

					<p> If anybody deserves to rule a kingdom and rightfully wear a crown on his head, it is Jamaal Charles, as he is the center piece of the Chiefs offense. His growing chemistry with Alex Smith makes him a likely candidate to lead all backs in total fantasy points. There is absolutely no reason that Jamaal Charles should be available after the second pick in the draft. Oh, and one last thing. Last year he scored a total of 19 touchdowns!

He put up career numbers last year, averaging 23 touches per game and finishing the year with 1,339 total rushing yards. Also, his fantasy value in PPR leagues has no ceiling. Pick him early with confidence, in all formats, as he could easily finish the season as the best fantasy running back. </p>

				<p>Forte has had serious injury concerns in the past, and after another year of playing in the NFL, his chances of re-injury are higher. Also, The Chicago Bears offense now features two elite receivers in Brandon Marshall and Alshon Jeffery. Although this did not affect Forte&apos;s performance a season ago, there is potential that the Bears will focus on getting the ball to their two standout wideouts more often. </p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> Not many runnings backs are as big of a workhorse as Marshawn Lynch. He is an extremely safe pick this year, as he is bound to go full beast mode as usual, and be showered in skittles…as usual. Last year, he became way more involved in the passing game, catching 37 passes, more than any previous year. Lynch is a solid pick, and should be considered in the late first round and early second round in most league formats. </p>
				</div>
				<div class = "offvert">
				</div>
				<div class = "shouldnot ">
				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>Lynch has some reasons of concern this year. Recent reports have claimed that Lynch is going to see 2-3 carries less per game. If this is true, that means that the Beast is going to be losing about 35-50 carries this season. That could be a serious deal breaker when thinking about what running back to take in that early second round. Also, his age could serve as a setback as younger, just as capable running backs are being drafted at around the same time as Lynch. He is also just about at the age that running backs begin to statistically decline at. BUST ALERT for Lynch this year. </p>

He set ridiculous records, throwing for 5.477 yards and 55 touchdowns, leading the Broncos to the Super Bowl.

The two of them combined for 147 catches last year and 1836 receiving yards. Those numbers will be difficult to replace and could drastically effect Manning&apos;s season. </p>

In his first season in the league, Martin accounted for 1,454 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns on the ground.  What makes Martin a top fantasy running back is his ability to catch the ball out of the backfield.

					<p> Over the last two years, DeMarco Murray has proven his worth as one of the top 15 running backs in the NFL.  Since becoming the feature back in Dallas, the Cowboys have shown that they are more than willing to feed Murray a ton of touches.  In his final 5 games of the 2013 regular season, Murray touched the ball at least 20 times in every game.  Murray&apos;s a work horse and a top running back talent in the NFL as long as he can stay on the field.

With Peyton Manning throwing him the football the last two seasons, Thomas has put up monster numbers.  Over Manning&apos;s hall of fame career, he has always had a go to receiver and Thomas has earned Peyton&apos;s respect in Denver&apos;s high-powered offense.  In addition to having one of the best quarterbacks in NFL history throwing him the football, Thomas should expect even more targets this season as a result of Eric Decker signing with the Jets in free agency.</p>

					<p> Jordy Nelson has racked in 30 touchdowns over the past three seasons. In 2011, Jordy hauled in 15 touchdowns. It would not be too surprising if Jordy went back to his old form and put up similar numbers. With James Jones in Oakland, and Jermichael Finley&apos;s status in question, look for Jordy to see a lot more red-zone action. The Jordy Nelson-Aaron Rodgers connection is a very powerful duo that fantasy owners should look for this year. Nelson should be considered a low end WR-1.  </p>

				<p>When Rodgers struggled to stay healthy last year, Nelson practically fell off of the map. It is pretty clear that Nelson needs his All-Pro quarterback in order to stay relevant. Also, Randall Cobb and Jared Boykin are taking targets away from Nelson on a weekly basis. Ultimately, Nelson is the best option in Green Bay, he just needs to find a way to consistently stay significant. </p>

					<p> Morris has very quietly been one of the most consistent fantasy players in the NFL since stepping onto the scene. He has had two straight seasons of 1,200-plus rushing yards, and it could easily be three. It is also a really good sign, that there is no running back in Washington that is even close to challenging the young running backs starting job. His value in standard leagues still remains very high. Morris will most likely give you double-digit touchdowns along also possibly finishing top 3 in rushing yards. </p>

				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>Morris serves practically no-use in the Redskins passing game. Jay Gruden has already stated that he does not believe that Morris has the receiving hands necessary to be a receiving back. This could serve as a problem because Gruden is a pass-first kind of coach, and could bring in Roy Helu in passing situations. Not to mention, Morris has a knack for fumbling (7 lost in the last two years), and Gruden can lose patience with that. Also, beware of RG3 possibly stealing red-zone carries from Morris. BUST ALERT for Alfred Morris. </p>

					<p> Alshon had a truly monster year in 2013, finishing with 89 catches for 1,421 receiving yards and seven touchdowns. After last year, he pretty much proved to everyone that he is the real deal. The reason why this guy shines is because so much defensive attention is placed on Forte and Marshall. In one-on-one coverages, Alshon is basically unstoppable, and he and Cutler are certainly on the same page. Although a small decline is extremely reasonable, look for Jeffery to have another very impressive season, possibly finishing as a top 5 wide out.  </p>

				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>The biggest reason to stray away for Jeffery is that there might not be enough love to go around the Bears offense this season. Alshon is no doubt the number three option in Chicago, and as Forte and Brandon Marshall continue to demand the ball, Alshon&apos;s numbers could decline. Also, after his breakout campaign, Alshon will not be able to sneak up on Defenses, and will not be left in single coverage as much as he was a season ago.</p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> Vincent Jackson is a physical specimen at the wide receiver position.  Week after week, Jackson is a mismatch for opposing defenses because Jackson excels at using his elite size to his advantage.  Jackson’s size also makes him a huge red zone threat which is a big plus for fantasy owners.  The Buccaneers also acquired Josh McCown and Mike Evans over the offseason, both of which should be beneficial to Jackson’s fantasy value.  With a more than serviceable quarterback and another receiver to take some pressure off Jackson, it’s reasonable to predict a top ten season amongst all wide receivers. </p>
				</div>
				<div class = "offvert">
				</div>
				<div class = "shouldnot ">
				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>Over his NFL career, a big concern for Jackson has always been his consistency.  While he is more than capable of putting up huge numbers any given week, he is equally capable of being a complete a bust. There were five games last season where Jackson couldn’t even record 40 receiving yards.  If you’re planning on  drafting Jackson as your number one receiver that can not happen again in 2014.</p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> Larry Fitzgerald was once regarded as one of the best wide receivers in all of football.  Although he has struggled to put up elite numbers the last four seasons, not all the blame can be put on himself.  Over the last four seasons, Fitzgerald had had to deal with very weak quarterback play.  With Carson Palmer returning for his second season under center for the Cardinals it’s possible that Fitzgerald could return to his elite form. </p>
				</div>
				<div class = "offvert">
				</div>
				<div class = "shouldnot ">
				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p> Fitzgerald plays in what most people would consider the best division in football.  St. Louis, San Francisco, and Seattle all have very strong defenses that are more than capable of slowing down Fitzgerald.  The emergence of wide receiver Michael Floyd may also negatively impact Larry Fitzgerald’s fantasy value because there is a good chance Fitzgerald will receive fewer targets.</p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> As the 12th overall pick in the 2010 NFL Draft there were high hopes that Ryan Mathews would be able to contribute right away for the San Diego Chargers.  It turns out that transition to the NFL wasn’t as easy as many experts predicted it to be for Mathews.  After three seasons of not coming anywhere near expectations, Mathews seemed to turn his career around during his 2013 campaign.  Mathews finally appeared to be the work horse many predicted him to become and played a huge role in the Chargers reaching the postseason. There were few, if any, running backs better than Mathews in the final four weeks of the regular season last year.  Will he be able to keep that momentum going? </p>

				<div class = "offvert">

				<div class = "shouldnot ">
				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>Mathews has a long history of injury issues. Over the last four years, he has missed a total of 10 games due to injuries.  To name just a few, Mathews has battled through concussion, hamstring, ankle, and foot injuries, which often can become reoccurring issues.  Another concern regarding Ryan Mathews is the trio of running backs already on the Chargers roster.  Mathews is going to have to split carries with both Danny Woodhead and Donald Brown, who have both proven they can contribute in the league.</p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> The Lions are among the preseason favorites to have the NFL’s best passing attack with Matthew Stafford at the helm. Detroit is oozing with talent at wide receiver including the leagues best in Calvin Johnson, former Seahawks standout Golden Tate, and first round draft pick Eric Ebron at tight end. On top of his numerous weapons at wide receiver, Stafford has two of the best receiving backs at his disposal in Reggie Bush and Joique Bell. This young quarterback has yet to reach his peak and with one of the most talented receiving corps in the NFL, Stafford is a top-5 QB in type of league with top-3 potential. </p>

				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>Stafford may have had a breakout season in 2011 but he has not been close to those numbers since. Although his 2013 numbers were an improvement from 2012, they were still nowhere close to his prolific numbers from his 2011 season. His attempts and completions were roughly the same between the 2011 and 2013 season yet he threw for 12 more touchdowns and three less picks in his 2011 campaign. Stafford has been good not great for the Lions and it is possible that in 2014 he doesn’t make that jump to the elite level. </p>

					<p> Very few running backs in the NFL have the potential upside that Spiller has. He has proven his ability to put up monstrous games both in the air and on the ground.Spiller managed over 100 total yards in five games last season, and of those 5 games, he went over 150 total yards twice.  Similar to running backs Chris Johnson and Adrian Peterson, Spiller has the ability to change the game on any play.</p>

				<p>Spiller was a first round draft pick in most fantasy leagues last year but didn’t quiet live up to the hype.  Fantasy owners willing to take a risk on Spiller this season should be worried about the crowded Buffalo backfield.  Along with bringing Fred Jackson back for his 8th season with the Bills, Buffalo went out and signed running back Bryce Brown in free agency.  Jackson took many of the goal line carries away from Spiller in 2013 and its pretty safe to expect that again for this upcoming season.</p>

				<p>The Panthers are bringing back zero, yes I said zero starting receivers from their 2013 team. Having a consistent receiving core is extremely important for a quarterback, especially a young one. Rookie Kelvin Benjamin is listed as the Panthers number one wide out. No matter having talented this young wide receiver is, he likely won’t be enough to help Newton stay at his all pro level. At this point the Panthers may bring in the Play 60 kid to line up in the slot for Newton.

Ellington has speed and quickness unlike most other running backs in the NFL and is nearly unstoppable in the open field.  Even with a very limited workload last season, Ellington was able to put up extremely respectable numbers.  If you’re in a PPR league Ellington carries even more value because of his great hands and ability to catch the football out of the backfield. </p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> Andrew Luck is the clear-cut future of the NFL. Very few quarterbacks have started their careers like Luck. The Colts franchise quarterback has combined for 8,196 passing yards, 46 passing touchdowns, 9 rushing touchdowns and only 27 picks in his first two seasons. Colts OC Pep Hamilton puts a strong emphasis on establishing a running game, which will help really help open, the passing game for Luck. With an impressive receiving corps comprised of a healthy Reggie Wayne, a star in the making in TY Hilton, and a savvy vet who has done it for years with Hakeem Nicks, don’t be surprised if Luck leads the league is passing yards and ends up as a top-3 fantasy QB in any league. </p>

				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>Colt’s OC Pep Hamilton has a run first mind-set when it comes to play calling. With a strong emphasis on the run, the Colts will focus their offensive attack on the ground ultimately leading to fewer chances for Luck to sling the ball. If Indianapolis’ running attack is able to get the job done, Luck can see his role for the offensive as a game manager and nothing more than that.  </p>

					<p> After an amazing Rookie campaign, Trent Richardson dissappointed all of his fantasy owners in a dissappointing Sophomore Season. However, after being traded to Indianapolis Trent played the remainder of the season with a broken shoulder. Not only that, but Richardson admitted that he was unable to fully grasp the Colt&apos;s complex offense in half a season. Donald Brown left the team in free agency and Vick Ballard had just had a season ending injury, increasing the hopes for a successful year from Richardson. Also, now that he has had an entire year to get more comfortable with the Colts offense, and fully healed, look for Richardson to return to his Rookie Form. </p>

					<p> Rice remains a big threat in PPR leagues as he has surpassed 55 receptions in 5 straight seasons. He was easily one of the most electric backs in the league. Brining in offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak should give the Ravens running game a tremendous lift as well. As of now Rice is considered a low-end RB2 or a flex, but he is one of those guys that could easily shock the world and slip into the top 10 running backs, especially in PPR formats.

				<p>For one thing, Rice is suspended for the first two games of the season.

It is also important to note that last year the Ravens had one of the most embarrassing offensive lines, ranking 23rd in the NFL.

					<p> There still remains to be some good potential with Steven Jackson. The fact of the matter is, with Julio Jones and Roddy White drawing the defense away from the box, SJAX could actually get some good looks. That potential is good considering his Average draft position is 106.23.

				<p>The biggest concern for Jackson is his age. At the age of 31, players do not typically get better. After tearing his hamstring in week 2, and disappointing pretty much every falcon’s fan, he definitely had a year to forget. The Falcons also drafted Devonta Freeman, who is according to sources, is a very good receiving back. SJAX finished with a career low in rushing yards (543), and since 2009, he has statistically declined in rushing yards, receptions, and receiving yards. Jackson is RB3 at best, as he could wind up on your bench for a lot of the season.</p>

					<p> TY Hilton is quickly becoming Andrew Luck’s favorite target. With Reggie Wayne getting injured last season, Hilton’s targets, catches, and receiving yards increased from his rookie to sophomore season. Andrew Luck and TY Hilton are quickly forming fantastic chemistry with each other and are developing into one of the leagues most formidable QB-WR tandems. Hilton has allegedly been practicing at all four receiving spots this off season, further proving the point that the Colts have big plans for the young receiver. With Reggie Wayne coming off a serious injury and Hakeem Nicks having to adjusting to a new offense and division after coming off a bad season, TY Hilton is the Colts one sure thing at receiver.   </p>

				<div class = "shouldnot ">
				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>No matter how much the Lions like Hilton he is still listed as their third receiver on their depth chart. Hilton was able to get as many targets as he did last season because Reggie went down with an injury. If Wayne is able to stay healthy look for Hilton to see a lot less targets. Hilton may have been the Colts number one receiver but he finished outside the top-15 in receptions, touchdowns, and receiving yards for all eligible receivers. Hilton’s stats didn’t stack up impressively compared to other number one options across the league. With Wayne back and Nicks in the mix Hilton’s numbers can easily slip at number three status. </p>

					<p>  In the second half of the 2013 season, Rashad Jennings burst into fantasy relevance.  Through the first half of the season, Jennings had very few opportunities to produce in Oakland, but in the final eight games of the season, Jennings averaged 15 carries a game and produced 583 yards.  Jennings does a great job of using his physicality to gain tough yards which makes him a dangerous red zone threat.  Jennings has also shown an ability to catch the football out of the backfield which could be huge in PPR leagues. </p>

				<p>Although Rashad Jennings is currently listed as the number one running back on the Giants website, that may not last for too long.

Along with David Wilson, Peyton Hillis will likely take a handful of carries away from Rashad Jennings this upcoming season.</p>

					<p> Torrey Smith is far and out the best reciever that the Ravens have. He turned it up a notch last season, ammassing 65 catches and joining the 1k recieving club with 1,128 yards. The fact that he only had 4 TDs last season is a bit of a fluke as he was the only true threat in the redzone. With the return of Dennis Pitta, and addition of Steve Smith, look for double digit TDs this season from Torrey Smith. Also, new offensive cordinator Gary Kubiak is known to HEAVILY target his WR #1.

Furthermore, he had just a 45.8 catch percentage on his targets, lowest for anyone with over 100 passes thrown to them. The fact of the matter is that he needs to start catching balls at a higher clip or he will never enter that elite reciever status. </p>

					<p> Stevan Ridley ended up last season with the 21st most rushing yards in the league (773). The person right after him? Former Patriots Running Back LeGarrette Blount. Easily the best thing that happened for Ridley value is the departure of Blout. Although he was sharing the load last year, if he can play well early on, watch out for Ridley to have a 2012 type year (1,263 rushing yards and 12 TDs). Oh, and let's not forget that Ridley will surely be super motivated as he enters a contract year.

				<p>The biggest obstacle in Stevan Ridley's way is clearly Shane Vereen. Make no mistake, at this point, Vereen is the favorite for that #1 RB spot for the Pats this year. Furthermore, Belichick lost his trust in Ridley during the season due to early fumble problems. Though Blount is gone, watch out for James white, rookie out of Wisconsin, to take some of his carries away if he has these issues again.   </p>

					<p> The jump Michael Floyd took from 2012 to 2013 by nearly doubling his receiving yards and more than doubling his touchdown total was no fluke. Floyd couldn&apos;t be in a better situation. With Larry Fitzgerald on the field Floyd will seldom see double coverage or the opposing teams best defensive back lined up in front of him. Throw in a veteran quarterback in Carson Palmer coming off a solid season, along side an offensive savant at head coach with Bruce Arians calling the plays, and Floyd is primed for a fantastic season.   </p>

This season, Wilson could put up even better numbers with the return of the ever so dangerous Percy Harvin.  After being forced to sit out almost all of the 2013 season with an injury, Harvin could be the weapon the Seahawks have been missing in the passing game.  In addition to devastating defenses with his passing ability, Wilson is capable of tucking the ball away and breaking a long run on any given play.

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> Watkins was easily the best wide-receiver taken in this years draft, thanks in part to his 224 receptions, 3,164 receiving yards, and 25 touchdowns in 35 games with Clemson. Buffalo lost Stevie Johnson, their top receiver this offseason, and Watkins has the immediate oppurtunity to be the number one target for the Bills. EJ Manuel looks to improve after his rookie campaign, and with CJ Spiller, Fred Jackson, and Robert Woods surrounding him, he has the potential to have an A.J. Green-esk Rookie Season.</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "offvert">
				</div>
				<div class = "shouldnot ">
				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>The biggest reason to not draft Watkins is his Quarterbacks lackluster 2013 season. Manuel threw for under 2000 yards, and only completed 180 passes. If Manuel does not improve, Watkins potential will be tremendously hindered. Also, it will be tough for Watkins to step in and immediately be the number one threat. With Stevie Johnson gone, there is really no one else on the Bills who can attract attention away from Watkins. </p>

					<p> In just his second year, Kendall Wright put up 94 catches on 139 targets. That catch rate, second only to Julian Edelman, is incredible and shows just how legit Wright is. The fact is that there is no way he will have just 2 TDs this year. His value could skyrocket if he begins putting up double-digit TDs and that is exactly what could happen this year. He had over 30 more catches then the next highest (Delanie Walker).

				<p> As Wright enters his third year, one questions just how great of a reciever he is. Though he has a high catch rate, he lacks that big play ability, with only one catch of 40-plus yards in his whole career. Furthermore, the fact that he was tied for 5th in touchtowns last season with Michael Preston (and if you're asking who's that, that is exactly my point), is very worrisome.    </p>

There are very few cornerbacks in the league that have the speed to keep up with Wallace, which makes him a homerun threat on every single play.

					<p> Terrance Williams had a nice Rookie Season in 2013, catching 44 balls for 736 Yards and 5 Touchdowns. In his Sophomore season, Williams will start opposite Dez Bryant and has a lot of appeal as Romo will look to check down to him more when Dez is double or even triple teamed. In Scott Linehan's pass happy offense, Williams can thrive. Also, Williams recorded a catch in all but one game last season, and had 14 of his 44 catches in the final five games. </p>

He also only surpassed four catches in a game twice last season, and no one would be surprised if that trend continued into this year.</p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p>Within the last five years, Maurice Jones-Drew was often regarded as a top five running back in the NFL.  MJD surprised fans year after year with his ability to put up outstanding numbers on an offense that had very few other weapons.  In 2011, MJD was so dominant that he won the rushing title.  MJD is currently in line to be the number two running back for the Raiders but with Darren McFaddens injury history it’s likely that MJD will assume a larger role than most backup running backs.  If MJD returns to anywhere near his 2011 form he could prove to be the steal of the draft.   </p>
				</div>
				<div class = "offvert">
				</div>
				<div class = "shouldnot ">
				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>In 2012, MJD suffered a Lisfranc fracture and he hasn’t been the same since.  When watching MJD, it is easy to see that he is unable to do a lot of things he excelled in during the 2011 season.  Along with having to compete with starting running back Darren McFadden for carries, there are two other running backs currently on the Raider’s roster who are also going to be fighting for playing time.  With many mouths to feed in the Oakland backfield, expectations should be very miniscule for MJD unless you expect McFadden to come down with another injury.</p>

He had not recorded that many catches since his last season in Arizona, and he clearly demonstrated that he is a reliable option week in and week out.Also, Boldin had 46 more receptions than anyone else on the 49ers in 2013, and was easily Kaepernick&apos;s favorite target all season long. Boldin has the ability to go up and grab a ball away from defenders, and is one of the more valuable red-zone threats in the NFL. </p>

				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>Boldin was able to have one of his best seasons in 2013 wihtout Michael Crabtree on the field for the most part. With a healthy Crabtree, the newly acquired Stevie Johnson, and Vernon Davis, the fortyniners have a lot of mouths to feed in 2014 and it could drastically hurt Boldin&apos; fantasy value. Not to mention, Boldin has played 11 full seasons in the NFL, and his age could finally be catching up to him. Boldin could find himself being the number 2 or possibly the number 3 options in some scenarios, and this could clearly affect his value.</p>

				<p>Pierce has been a nice third done back for the Raven’s but hasn’t showed many signs of being an every down option.

If those numbers didn’t turn you away, take into account that Ray Rice will be healthy and eligible after week two. With Rice getting the job done for years in Baltimore, he can easy be the star of the running game leave Pierce as a inconsistent handcuff. </p>

					<p> Riley Cooper was a very pleasant surprise for many fantasy owners last season.  Although he went undrafted in many leagues, Cooper was able to excel in Chip Kelly’s offense and became Nick Foles’ favorite target.

					<p> Coming in to the 2013 season many predicted Jordan Cameron to have the biggest breakout season amongst unproven tight ends. After 80 receptions for 917 yards and 7 touchdowns Cameron proved all those right who put faith in him by proclaiming him as the next fantasy stud tight end. Cameron finished second amongst all tight ends in targets and catches. With Josh Gordon facing a potential season long suspension look for Cameron to be Cleveland’s number one passing option. In a position with little depth, look for Cameron to shine as one of top fantasy tight ends.  </p>

				<p>The Browns come into the 2014 season with a ton of questions. Most importantly who will be their starting quarterback and will Josh Gordon be able to play this season. With that being said, it will come down to a highly speculated quarterback for off field issues in Jonny Manziel or an unproven quarterback coming off an injury in Brian Hoyer throwing the ball for Cleveland. Neither of those two options are very appealing for the young tight end. With Josh Gordon likely being done for the season, Cameron will consistently face double teams, ultimately hurting his fantasy stock. </p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> Even though last season was considered an off year for the Falcon’s franchise quarterback, Ryan was still able to have career highs in attempts and completions as well as his second highest passing yards total in a season. The injury bug stung the Falcon’s often last season. Julio Jones missed 11 games, Steven Jackson was out for 5 and Roddy White played all of 2013 not 100%. Coming into the 2014 season Ryan arguably has the best wide receiver tandem to throw to this season with a healthy Jones and White. On top of that the Falcons drafted stand out offensive tackle Jake Matthews with the 6th overall pick. With an extremely talented and healthy receiving corps to throw to and a revamped offensive line to protect him, look for Ryan to have a comeback monster season. </p>

				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>It’s never a good sign to draft a quarterback starting for a team coming off a 4-12 season. Last season Ryan had a career high in interceptions and a career low in wins for a season. With a suspect running attack being led by an aging Steven Jackson who has a ton of questions regarding his health, look for Ryan to have to throw the ball too often once again. Add in to the mix an unproven offensive line and Julio Jones coming off a second broken foot since 2011, Matt Ryan could be facing another season filled with forced passes and interceptions. </p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> Tom Brady is a beast.  When his career is over Brady will undoubtedly go down as one of the best quarterbacks in NFL history.  The last couple of seasons Brady has been forced to compete with very mediocre wide receivers and has still put up elite numbers.  With tight end Rob Gronkowski on the bench the first few weeks of the 2013 season, Brady had trouble meshing with his young receiving corps and didn’t post the numbers that we have grown accustomed to seeing.  Once Gronk returned in the second half of the season, Brady returned to his elite form throwing at least one touchdown in every game.  If Gronk remains healthy this season, expect more big numbers from Brady.  </p>

				<div class = "offvert">

				<div class = "shouldnot ">
				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>Over the last couple of seasons, Gronk has obviously been a huge part of the Patriots offensive game plan.  Unfortunately, Gronk has had a lot of trouble staying healthy and off the sideline which greatly impacts Brady’s fantasy value. Although they have another year under their belt, many people still question if the Patriot’s young receiving corps has what it take to take their offense to the next level.</p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> There are a plethora of reasons to be extremely high on Dennis Pitta this upcoming season.  For starters, Dennis Pitta has a special relationship with quarterback Joe Flacco and has quickly become his favorite target.  Additionally, with the return of Torrey Smith and arrival of Steve Smith through free agency, Pitta should have more than enough room to operate in the middle of the field.  Lastly, and arguably the biggest reason to have high expectations for Pitta this year is because of his new offensive coordinator, Gary Kubiak.  Throughout Kubiak’s tenure in Houston, tight ends played a key role on the offensive side of the football and Houston never had a tight end as skilled as Pitta.  Although he’s not named among the elite tight ends, Pitta could definitely crack the top 5 by the end of the season. </p>

				<div class = "offvert">
				</div>
				<div class = "shouldnot ">
				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>Pitta missed almost all of the 2013 season after he fractured and dislocated his hip in training camp.  After going down with the injury, Pitta was expected to miss the entire season but ended up returning in week 14.  Pitta failed to impress in his return as he looked to lack explosiveness.  Another worry for Pitta is that there could be a lack of balls to go around in Baltimore with Steve Smith, Torrey Smith, Jacoby Jones, and Owen Daniels all expected to contribute.</p>

				<p>In his first two seasons in the league, Lamar Miller hasn’t done enough to solidify himself as a fantasy starter.  In addition to fantasy owners, the Dolphins don’t seem too content with Lamar Miller carrying the football because they likely wouldn’t have signed Knowshon Moreno in free agency. It is going to take a different Lamar Miller than football fans saw in his first two seasons to steal carries away from Moreno. </p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> When Jay Cutler started a season ago, he showed flashes of brilliance. He comes into this season fully healthy, with one of the most explosive offenses in the NFL. He posted his highest QBR and Completion Percentage since 2007 last season, and had he not gotten hurt, he was on pace to be a top 5 fantasy Quarterback. With two of the best receivers in the league in Alshon Jeffery and Brandon Marshall, and arguably the most explosive Running back in the Nfl in Matt Forte, Cutler has the weapons to have the best season of his career in 2014.</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "offvert">
				</div>
				<div class = "shouldnot ">
				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>The main concern with Cutler heading into 2014 is injury concern. He missed most of the 2013 season with injuries, and he has not played 16 games in any of his last four seasons. Also, when Cutler did play last season, he threw 12 interceptions compared to only 19 touchdowns. If the Bears offensive line cannot keep Cutler healthy in 2014, it will not even matter how explosive the Bears offensive weapons are.</p>

					<p> After being a very small part of the Bengals offensive plan in 2012, Jones became a very effective wide receiver two with the Bengals in 2013.  Even though A.J. Green is the clear favorite receiver to quarterback Andy Dalton, Jones received his fair share of targets in 2013.  In fact, although most people view A.J. Green as one of the most dangerous red zone threats in the league, Jones tallied more red zone touchdowns than Green last season.  With Green drawing the attention of defenses on nearly every play, Jones could be a very productive third or flex receiver on your fantasy team. </p>

				<p>The Cincinnati Bengals have a ton of receiving options to choose from but only one football to go around.

The Bengals also brought in Hue Jackson as the new offensive coordinator who would like to turn the Bengals into a more run oriented football team which is not a good sign for Marvin Jones.</p>

					<p>Although Dwayne Bowe&apos;s 2013 campaing was largely dissappointing, he did lead his team in targets, and led all Wide Receivers on the Chiefs in Touchdown Receptions. In his final 7 games last season, Bowe was able to accumulate 59 targets, and 31 receptions, over half of his total production. Also, the Chiefs lost McCluster in free agency this season, who had 81 targets and 53 receptions. If Bowe is able to bounce back and take McCluster&apos;s receptions he could have a solid season.</p>

				<p>Dwayne Bowe&apos;s season was extremely dissappointing, as he only had 57 receptions for 673 yards.

Also, Bowe was only able to rack in more than 5 catches once a season ago, showing that his potential is not through the roof as some would speculate. Dwayne bowe only caught 54% of his total targets in 2013, a horrific number, and we would not be surprised if Alex Smith shyed away from Bowe in 2013 for a more reliable option. </p>

					<p> Hakeem Nicks left the New York Giants this offseason to join the Colts with a one-year "Prove Yourself" deal. After a dissappointing campaign in 2013, Nicks has a great chance to rebound with Andrew Luck throwing him passes, a tremendous upgrade from the woeful Eli Manning. Also, Nicks will be surrounded by a ton of talent with Reggie Wayne, TY Hilton, and Trent Richardson. If Nicks is able to expose the one on one coverage he expects to see, he could easily become Luck&apos;s favorite down the field target, which could pay huge dividends for fantasy owners. </p>

The Panther&apos;s receiving is completely depleted heading into 2014, and this means that teams will likely load up the box on Carolina, making their number one goal to stop the run.

					<p>Aaron Dobson was only fully healthy for 9 games last season, and in those games, he had 7 or more targets in all but three. Coming into 2014, he has seperated himself from Kenbrell Thompkins, and looks slotted as the number two receiver for Tom Brady and the Patriots. He has the potential to be an extremely dangerous deep threat, as he recorded passes of 10 yards or more in all of the games he was healthy. Julian Edelman will be the focus of the short passing game and Aaron Dobson can find himself playing the Randy Moss-type role for the Pats this season.</p>

				<p>The problem with Dobson is that his role is still up in the air.

Dobson&apos;s 37 receptions and 519 yards were very underwhelming, and if he is unable to stay healthy he could easily be passed in the depth chart. The patriots wide receiver corp is always crowded and at the end of the day it comes down to who Tom Brady feels the most comfortable throwing the ball to, which could easily end up being someone other than Dobson.</p>

					<p>When the Bengals selected Jeremy Hill in the second round of this years draft, it surprised a lot of people, especially since they picked Giovani Bernard the year before and still have Benjarvus Green Ellis under contract. However, Hill is an extremely talented back. He rushed for 1940 yards and 26 touchdowns at LSU last year, and if he is able to pass the Law Firm on the depth chart, he has the potential to score a lot of red zone touchdowns. The Bengals clearly had a motive spending a second round pick on Hill, so do not be surprised if he has a nice rookie season splitting time with Gio Bernard.</p>

				<p>Regardless of how much Hill is able to impress the Bengals coaches, he will have an extremely difficult time passing Giovani Bernard on the Bengals depth charts. At best, he will fill the Law Firms role, which only led to 756 rushing yards a season ago. The Bengals like to have Gio on the field as a change of pace receiving back, and Hill only had 26 receptions for LSU a season ago. In PPR leagues, Hill&apos;s value goes down the drain, however he could find his way to over 8 touchdowns if hes inserted in goal line situations.</p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> James Jones was signed by Oakland to be their number one receiver, and the team brought in an above average QB in Matt Schaub who will hopefully be able to get Jones the ball. The Raiders will also be viewed as a run heavy team with Maurice Jones-Drew and Darren McFadden, which will hopefully allow Jones to operate in single coverage. </p>

				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>James Jones goes from having Aaron Rodgers throw him the ball to Matt Schaub. His production could easily decrease especially since the Raiders are a much worse team than the Packers. Also, Jones has never been used as a number 1 receiver before, and he might find it difficult to operate with a lot of defensive attention being thrown his way.</p>

					<p> If anybody deserves to rule a kingdom and rightfully wear a crown on his head, it is Jamaal Charles, as he is the center piece of the Chiefs offense. His growing chemistry with Alex Smith makes him a likely candidate to lead all backs in total fantasy points. There is absolutely no reason that Jamaal Charles should be available after the second pick in the draft. Oh, and one last thing. Last year he scored a total of 19 touchdowns! I repeat: 19 touchdowns! </p>

					<p> Miller&apos;s dissappointing season last year can be attributed to him recovering from ACL surgery, and now that he is fully healthy he has a chance to return to his form of 2012.
