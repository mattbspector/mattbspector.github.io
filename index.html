					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> 2013 was a career high year for Lesean Mccoy. He set career highs with 314 carries and 1,607 rushing yards. He is also considered a king of the PPR throne, having more than 50 catches in three of the last four seasons. Shady truly benefits from a Chip Kelly run-heavy offense, and a possible 2000 yard season does not seem out of reach. Look for Mccoy to have another impressive season as he rules the one of the many PPR kingdoms.<p>
				</div>
				<div class = "offvert">
				</div>
				<div class = "shouldnot ">
				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>Having a less impressive season than his 2013 season is almost inevitable. It is extremely likely that his Rushing Yards per game will decrease, and his opportunities to catch passes from the backfield might regress as well. The Eagles brought in PPR monster Darren Sproles this offseason, and he is expected to take away some of Mccoy&apos;s reps. However, Sproles should not be the reason you do not draft McCoy. Just look for a slight regression this year compared to his 2013 campaign.</p>

					<p> Not many runnings backs are as big of a workhorse as Marshawn Lynch. He is an extremely safe pick this year, as he is bound to go full beast mode as usual, and be showered in skittles…as usual. Last year, he became way more involved in the passing game, catching 37 passes, more than any previous year. Lynch is a solid pick, and should be considered in the late first round and early second round in most league formats. </p>

				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>Lynch has some reasons of concern this year. Recent reports have claimed that Lynch is going to see 2-3 carries less per game. If this is true, that means that the Beast is going to be losing about 35-50 carries this season. That could be a serious deal breaker when thinking about what running back to take in that early second round. Also, his age could serve as a setback as younger, just as capable running backs are being drafted at around the same time as Lynch. He is also just about at the age that running backs begin to statistically decline at. BUST ALERT for Lynch this year. </p>

					<p> In 2013, Peyton Manning had arguably the best season for a quarterback in NFL history. He completely dominated, not just other quarterbacks, but every other player in Total Fantasy Points. He set ridiculous records, throwing for 5.477 yards and 55 touchdowns, leading the Broncos to the Super Bowl. With the addition of Emmanuel Sanders and the late season emergence of Montee Ball, things are only pointing up for Manning, who could easily be the top Fantasy Quarterback for the second straight year.  </p>

				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>For the second straight year, Manning will be the oldest starting Quarterback in the NFL, and one can only wonder how many more great prefomances he has left in him. If he takes one bad hit he could easily be done for the year. Furthermore, Manning lost two of his top weapons in Eric Decker and Knowshon Moreno. The two of them combined for 147 catches last year and 1836 receiving yards. Those numbers will be difficult to replace and could drastically effect Manning&apos;s season. </p>

					<p>1. &nbsp;If you were in a league in which every passing touchdown was worth 4 points, Manning averaged 30 fantasy points per game. </p>

					<p> Coming out of college there were many questions surrounding Martin and if his playing style would translate well to the NFL.  As a rookie, Martin managed to silence his critics.  In his first season in the league, Martin accounted for 1,454 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns on the ground.  What makes Martin a top fantasy running back is his ability to catch the ball out of the backfield.  Along with his outstanding numbers on the ground during his rookie seasons, he also gained 472 yards and one touchdown through the air.  With the addition of Mike Evans through the draft and Vincent Jackson already on the roster, expect Martin to definitely have some room to operate.</p>

				<p>Martin wasn&apos;t able to reproduce his rookie numbers in his second year in the league.  It seemed as if opposing defenses were keying in on Martin and weren&apos;t allowing him to control the game.  Martin was also hampered by injuries last year, as he was forced to miss 10 games with a torn shoulder labrum.  Whoever drafts Martin better hope that the injury bug doesn&apos;t reappear. </p>

					<p> Arian Foster was once the king of fantasy.  In 2010, Foster was so dominant that he won the rushing title.  Foster has already proven that he is capable of carrying an offense.  Throughout his career, Foster has been a touchdown machine.  In 3 of his last 4 seasons, Foster has accounted for at least 10 touchdowns on the ground.  In addition to his contributions in the rushing game, Foster has also been a huge part of the Houston Texan&apos;s aerial assault.

Over the last three years, Foster has missed 11 regular season games due to injuries and he is coming off a major back surgery.  In addition to injury concerns, the quarterback position should worry potential Arian Foster owners.  Without a dangerous quarterback opposing defenses may stack the box to prevent Foster from running all over them.</p>

Although he made the team, Stacy saw very little action in his first four regular season games, only receiving a grand total of one touch.  In week 5 Stacy proved his worth when he touched the ball 17 times and ran for 78 yards.  From week 5 to the end of the regular season, Stacy averaged just under 21 carries a game.  Unlike many other number one running backs, Stacy also happened to do a lot of his damage in the redzone.

					<p> Drew Brees is a fantasy King.  Year after year Brees puts up sensational numbers for the New Orleans Saints.  Ever since joining the Saints in 2006, Brees has only played one season in which he has thrown for fewer than 4,400 yards.  Not even Peyton Manning, Aaron Rodgers, or Tom Brady have been able to accomplish those insane numbers.  It is safe to assume another monster year from Brees this upcoming season with Jimmy Graham and Marques Colston returning and the addition of first round pick Brandin Cooks. </p>

				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>One argument could be made that with the departure of Darren Sproles through free agency, Brees has lost his favorite check down receiver, which in turn could reduce his production.  Another possible downside is that Brees is sometimes prone to throwing interceptions.  The last four seasons, Brees has thrown a total of 67 interceptions.  </p>

Bryant put up huge numbers last season but it&apos;s very reasonable to predict better numbers this year with the addition of Scott Linehan as offensive coordinator.

					<p> Le&apos;Veon Bell had a very solid but not overwhelming rookie season.  As the season progressed, Bell became much more involved in the Pittsburgh Steelers offense.  Along with being a productive back on the ground, Bell is one of the better pass-catching running backs in the league.

				<p>Over the offseason, the Steelers made some moves that should make Le&apos;Veon Bell fans a little curious.  Pittsburgh spent some money in free agency to bring in LeGarrette Blount as well as used a third round draft pick on Kent State running back Dri Archer.  With many mouths to feed in the Pittsburgh backfield, Le&apos;veon Bell could see a reduction in his workload.  Another worry is that early in his NFL career, Bell has already fought through concussion issues, which is always a red flag for fantasy owners.</p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> As the 12th overall pick in the 2010 NFL Draft there were high hopes that Ryan Mathews would be able to contribute right away for the San Diego Chargers.  It turns out that transition to the NFL wasn’t as easy as many experts predicted it to be for Mathews.  After three seasons of not coming anywhere near expectations, Mathews seemed to turn his career around during his 2013 campaign.  Mathews finally appeared to be the work horse many predicted him to become and played a huge role in the Chargers reaching the postseason. There were few, if any, running backs better than Mathews in the final four weeks of the regular season last year.  Will he be able to keep that momentum going? </p>
				</div>
				<div class = "offvert">
				</div>
				<div class = "shouldnot ">
				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>Mathews has a long history of injury issues. Over the last four years, he has missed a total of 10 games due to injuries.  To name just a few, Mathews has battled through concussion, hamstring, ankle, and foot injuries, which often can become reoccurring issues.  Another concern regarding Ryan Mathews is the trio of running backs already on the Chargers roster.  Mathews is going to have to split carries with both Danny Woodhead and Donald Brown, who have both proven they can contribute in the league.</p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> The Lions are among the preseason favorites to have the NFL’s best passing attack with Matthew Stafford at the helm. Detroit is oozing with talent at wide receiver including the leagues best in Calvin Johnson, former Seahawks standout Golden Tate, and first round draft pick Eric Ebron at tight end. On top of his numerous weapons at wide receiver, Stafford has two of the best receiving backs at his disposal in Reggie Bush and Joique Bell. This young quarterback has yet to reach his peak and with one of the most talented receiving corps in the NFL, Stafford is a top-5 QB in type of league with top-3 potential. </p>

				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>Stafford may have had a breakout season in 2011 but he has not been close to those numbers since. Although his 2013 numbers were an improvement from 2012, they were still nowhere close to his prolific numbers from his 2011 season. His attempts and completions were roughly the same between the 2011 and 2013 season yet he threw for 12 more touchdowns and three less picks in his 2011 campaign. Stafford has been good not great for the Lions and it is possible that in 2014 he doesn’t make that jump to the elite level. </p>

					<p> Very few running backs in the NFL have the potential upside that Spiller has. He has proven his ability to put up monstrous games both in the air and on the ground.Spiller managed over 100 total yards in five games last season, and of those 5 games, he went over 150 total yards twice.

				<p>Spiller was a first round draft pick in most fantasy leagues last year but didn’t quiet live up to the hype.  Fantasy owners willing to take a risk on Spiller this season should be worried about the crowded Buffalo backfield.  Along with bringing Fred Jackson back for his 8th season with the Bills, Buffalo went out and signed running back Bryce Brown in free agency.  Jackson took many of the goal line carries away from Spiller in 2013 and its pretty safe to expect that again for this upcoming season.</p>

					<p> It came as quite a surprise when Keenan Allen put up the monster stats that he did in 2013. But after hauling in 71 catches for 1,046 and 8 trips to the end zone, it came as no surprise that he finished second in votes for offensive rookie of the year behind Green Bay&apos;s Eddie Lacy. With a pass happy offense and Phillip Rivers coming off a tremendous season, things are looking good for the Allen heading into his sophomore season. </p>

				<p>Although Allen had a stand out season in 2013, towards the final stretch his play started to decline. With an aging Antonio Gates, along with a cast of receivers that didn&apos;t pose an intimidating threat to opposing secondaries, defenses put a strong emphasis on containing Allen and the results showed. Unless someone by the likes of Vincent Brown, Eddie Royal, Ladarius Green, or Malcom Floyd steps up Allen will continue to face double teams and his numbers will suffer.</p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> With an ailing Hakeem Nicks and a horrid run game, Cruz was constantly smothered last season. The development of Ruben Randle, a healthy David Wilson in the backfield, and the addition of LSU stand out receiver Odell Beckham Jr., will do nothing but help free up Victor Cruz as he tries to put up the numbers he did during his 2011 and 2012 campaigns.  Cruz is one of the more talented receivers in the NFL and it&apos;s very possible come Sunday he could be doing a lot of salsa dancing in the end zone this season. </p>

				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>Regardless of how talented a receiver is, if the person throwing the ball cant get it to the receiver his numbers will suffer. That is exactly what happened to Cruz after Eli Manning had a season where he threw the ball to the other team 27 times. Cruz&apos;s receiving yards have decreased each season since his break out performance in 2011. If that trend continues the way it has the past two seasons and Eli Manning manages to be anywhere close to as terrible as he was last season it could be a rough year for Cruz and the G Men. </p>

					<p> Cam Newton may not actually be superman but he has all the physical attributes of a superhero. Between his deep threat with his arm and his incredible running abilities, Newton is the best dual threat quarterback the NFL has to offer. According to ESPN standard scoring, Newton has finished as a top 4 fantasy squaring quarterback in each of his first three seasons. With another season under his belt and one of the leagues best defenses that will help keep him on the field to put up numbers, expect another super season from Carolina’s finest.  </p>

				<p>The Panthers are bringing back zero, yes I said zero starting receivers from their 2013 team. Having a consistent receiving core is extremely important for a quarterback, especially a young one. Rookie Kelvin Benjamin is listed as the Panthers number one wide out. No matter having talented this young wide receiver is, he likely won’t be enough to help Newton stay at his all pro level. At this point the Panthers may bring in the Play 60 kid to line up in the slot for Newton. Since his rookie season, Newton’s passing yard and rushing touchdown totals have both dropped and that trend can easily continue if no wide receivers step up in a big way. </p>

					<p> As he entered the NFL, expectations were extremely low for Ellington to produce solid fantasy numbers.  Just a couple of weeks into the season he proved his critics wrong.  Ellington has speed and quickness unlike most other running backs in the NFL and is nearly unstoppable in the open field.  Even with a very limited workload last season, Ellington was able to put up extremely respectable numbers.  If you’re in a PPR league Ellington carries even more value because of his great hands and ability to catch the football out of the backfield. </p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> After an amazing Rookie campaign, Trent Richardson dissappointed all of his fantasy owners in a dissappointing Sophomore Season. However, after being traded to Indianapolis Trent played the remainder of the season with a broken shoulder. Not only that, but Richardson admitted that he was unable to fully grasp the Colt&apos;s complex offense in half a season. Donald Brown left the team in free agency and Vick Ballard had just had a season ending injury, increasing the hopes for a successful year from Richardson. Also, now that he has had an entire year to get more comfortable with the Colts offense, and fully healed, look for Richardson to return to his Rookie Form. </p>

				<p>In 2013, Richardson was flat out awful. He had only 563 rushing yards and three touchdowns, resulting in him being labeled as one of the biggest busts of the year. It is often curious to see a star RB such as Trent Richardson lose a ton of snaps to his backup, and if the Colts do not believe in Richardson in 2014, it could be another year in the gutter.</p>

					<p> Crabtree has truly developed into a weapon and an offensive threat for the Niners. From 2010-2012, his reception total has gradually increased from 55 to 72 to 85. Kaepernick has a strong connection with Crabtree and he will most likely be Kaepernick’s favorite target. In 2012, Crabtree almost got a third of Kaepernick’s targets and should go back to his 2012 form this season. Look for Crabtree to possibly rake in 85 catches and have a 1,200-plus receiving yards.

With Anquan Boldin, Stevie Johnson, and Vernon Davis in the mix, it might be harder for Crabtree to hold on to being a top option for Kap. Not to mention, Harbaugh likes to run the ball, a lot.

					<p> Rice remains a big threat in PPR leagues as he has surpassed 55 receptions in 5 straight seasons. He was easily one of the most electric backs in the league. Brining in offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak should give the Ravens running game a tremendous lift as well. As of now Rice is considered a low-end RB2 or a flex, but he is one of those guys that could easily shock the world and slip into the top 10 running backs, especially in PPR formats. If you can get him pretty low in the draft because people are worried about the risk, pull the trigger.  </p>

				<p>For one thing, Rice is suspended for the first two games of the season. This does not help his case, especially if Bernard Pierce plays well and challenges Rice for touches after the first two games. He is also coming off what is easily the worst season of his career, rushing for 660 yards (44 yards per game).  It is also important to note that last year the Ravens had one of the most embarrassing offensive lines, ranking 23rd in the NFL. Rice is a very shaky investment in 2014, that very well might not pay off. </p>

					<p> There still remains to be some good potential with Steven Jackson. The fact of the matter is, with Julio Jones and Roddy White drawing the defense away from the box, SJAX could actually get some good looks. That potential is good considering his Average draft position is 106.23. Jackson did seem to be in solid form at the end of last season and if he is able to keep that form going into 2014, he could be looking at double digit touchdowns.  </p>

				<p>The biggest concern for Jackson is his age. At the age of 31, players do not typically get better. After tearing his hamstring in week 2, and disappointing pretty much every falcon’s fan, he definitely had a year to forget. The Falcons also drafted Devonta Freeman, who is according to sources, is a very good receiving back. SJAX finished with a career low in rushing yards (543), and since 2009, he has statistically declined in rushing yards, receptions, and receiving yards. Jackson is RB3 at best, as he could wind up on your bench for a lot of the season.</p>

Andrew Luck and TY Hilton are quickly forming fantastic chemistry with each other and are developing into one of the leagues most formidable QB-WR tandems. Hilton has allegedly been practicing at all four receiving spots this off season, further proving the point that the Colts have big plans for the young receiver.

				<p>No matter how much the Lions like Hilton he is still listed as their third receiver on their depth chart. Hilton was able to get as many targets as he did last season because Reggie went down with an injury. If Wayne is able to stay healthy look for Hilton to see a lot less targets. Hilton may have been the Colts number one receiver but he finished outside the top-15 in receptions, touchdowns, and receiving yards for all eligible receivers.

					<p> The jump Michael Floyd took from 2012 to 2013 by nearly doubling his receiving yards and more than doubling his touchdown total was no fluke. Floyd couldn&apos;t be in a better situation. With Larry Fitzgerald on the field Floyd will seldom see double coverage or the opposing teams best defensive back lined up in front of him. Throw in a veteran quarterback in Carson Palmer coming off a solid season, along side an offensive savant at head coach with Bruce Arians calling the plays, and Floyd is primed for a fantastic season.   </p>

					<p> Bell may be considered the Lion&apos;s second option out of the backfield but he&apos;s definitely unlike any other #2 back in the NFL. Bell is one of the league leaders for touches amongst #2 backs and he was used in a big way for the Lion&apos;s passing game. With Joe Lombardi (a former Sean Payton mentee) as the Lion&apos;s new OC, expect a ton of balls thrown Bell&apos;s way.

					<p> Pierre Thomas had a phenomenal year in 2013, leading the Saints in Rushing Yards and Rushing Attempts. Not to mention, he also led all Running Backs in receptions in 2013 with 77. Thomas has a great chance to increase his production from a season ago as Darren Sproles left the Saints in Free Agency. Sproles also accounted for 71 receptions of his own, and if Thomas is able to carry even half of Sproles offensive load, he could easily pass the 100 reception mark.</p>

Also, Pierre Thomas only had 549 yards on the ground, putting him outside the top 30 backs in total rushing yards.

					<p> Watkins was easily the best wide-receiver taken in this years draft, thanks in part to his 224 receptions, 3,164 receiving yards, and 25 touchdowns in 35 games with Clemson. Buffalo lost Stevie Johnson, their top receiver this offseason, and Watkins has the immediate oppurtunity to be the number one target for the Bills. EJ Manuel looks to improve after his rookie campaign, and with CJ Spiller, Fred Jackson, and Robert Woods surrounding him, he has the potential to have an A.J. Green-esk Rookie Season.</p>

				<p>The biggest reason to not draft Watkins is his Quarterbacks lackluster 2013 season. Manuel threw for under 2000 yards, and only completed 180 passes. If Manuel does not improve, Watkins potential will be tremendously hindered. Also, it will be tough for Watkins to step in and immediately be the number one threat.

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> Coming off of the best season of his career in 2013, Golden Tate should likely have an even better year in 2014 after joining the pass-happy Lions. Tate will play opposite the beset receiver in the NFL in Calvin Johnson, and will likely find himself seeing single coverage every time he takes the field. Golden Tate will likely see a huge jump in his targets per game, as Detroit&apos;s number two receiver&apos;s were targeted 159 times in 2013, almost 50 more than Tate had in 2013.</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "offvert">
				</div>
				<div class = "shouldnot ">
				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>The problem with Golden Tate is that we do not know how he will preform in an offense that is built around the passing game. In Seattle, teams would load up the box and leave very few defenders to guard against the pass as the Seahwaks ran 100 more rushing plays than passing plays. In Detroit, teams will now line up with more defensive backs on the field, and how Tate will react to this is still a giant question mark.</p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> Terrance Williams had a nice Rookie Season in 2013, catching 44 balls for 736 Yards and 5 Touchdowns. In his Sophomore season, Williams will start opposite Dez Bryant and has a lot of appeal as Romo will look to check down to him more when Dez is double or even triple teamed. In Scott Linehan's pass happy offense, Williams can thrive. Also, Williams recorded a catch in all but one game last season, and had 14 of his 44 catches in the final five games. </p>

				<p>The Downside to Picking Terrance Williams is that there might be too many mouths to feed in Dallas this season. With Dez Bryant, a pass-catching stud RunningBack in Demarco Murray, and Jason Witten as Tight End, it will be difficult for Terrance Williams to demand targets. He also only surpassed four catches in a game twice last season, and no one would be surprised if that trend continued into this year.</p>

					<p>Boldin had one of his best season in 2013 with 85 catches for 1,179 yards and 7 TDs. He had not recorded that many catches since his last season in Arizona, and he clearly demonstrated that he is a reliable option week in and week out.Also, Boldin had 46 more receptions than anyone else on the 49ers in 2013, and was easily Kaepernick&apos;s favorite target all season long. Boldin has the ability to go up and grab a ball away from defenders, and is one of the more valuable red-zone threats in the NFL. </p>

				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>Boldin was able to have one of his best seasons in 2013 wihtout Michael Crabtree on the field for the most part. With a healthy Crabtree, the newly acquired Stevie Johnson, and Vernon Davis, the fortyniners have a lot of mouths to feed in 2014 and it could drastically hurt Boldin&apos; fantasy value. Not to mention, Boldin has played 11 full seasons in the NFL, and his age could finally be catching up to him. Boldin could find himself being the number 2 or possibly the number 3 options in some scenarios, and this could clearly affect his value.</p>

					<p> Hopkins looks to build on his decent but dissappointing Rookie campaign in 2014, with the hopes that an offense more catered to his skillset and a more favorable QB situation will launch him into the fantasy elite. He did show some flashes his Rookie season, recording double digit targets in two games, and if Andre Johnson is not able to stay healthy, Hopkins will become the number one option in a Passing friendly offense under Bill O'Brien. </p>

				<p>DeAndre&apos;s 52 receptions for 802 yards and 2 TDs were widely dissappointing a season ago. He was not as explosive as most people would have hoped, and the Texans rarely used him as a possession receiver in the redzone. If the trends continue from 2013, Hopkins will once again be an average WR and have basically no fantasy appeal.</p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> Coming in to the 2013 season many predicted Jordan Cameron to have the biggest breakout season amongst unproven tight ends. After 80 receptions for 917 yards and 7 touchdowns Cameron proved all those right who put faith in him by proclaiming him as the next fantasy stud tight end. Cameron finished second amongst all tight ends in targets and catches. With Josh Gordon facing a potential season long suspension look for Cameron to be Cleveland’s number one passing option. In a position with little depth, look for Cameron to shine as one of top fantasy tight ends.  </p>

				<div class = "shouldnot ">
				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>The Browns come into the 2014 season with a ton of questions. Most importantly who will be their starting quarterback and will Josh Gordon be able to play this season. With that being said, it will come down to a highly speculated quarterback for off field issues in Jonny Manziel or an unproven quarterback coming off an injury in Brian Hoyer throwing the ball for Cleveland. Neither of those two options are very appealing for the young tight end. With Josh Gordon likely being done for the season, Cameron will consistently face double teams, ultimately hurting his fantasy stock. </p>

					<p> In 15 games last season, Tony Romo threw for 3828 Yards and recorded 31 Passing Touchdowns. His Passing Touchdown total was good for 5th among Quarterbacks, and with new pass-happy offensive coordinator Scott Linehan coming into the mix, things are only looking up for Romo. Also, Romo has some of the best skill players in the league surrounding him in Dez Bryant, Terrance Williams, Jason Witten, and Demarco Murray, and Linehan will no doubt find a way to make sure Romo gets all of them the ball. </p>

				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>Tony Romo had back surgery this offseason, and the major concern with him is injury and that he might take a few games to shake off the rust. Also, losing one of his favorite targets in Miles Austin could make life more difficult for Romo and could result in Dez Bryant seeing even more defensive attention. Romo also has one of the shakiest offensive lines in the NFL, and this could significantly affect his fantasy value. </p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> When Jay Cutler started a season ago, he showed flashes of brilliance. He comes into this season fully healthy, with one of the most explosive offenses in the NFL. He posted his highest QBR and Completion Percentage since 2007 last season, and had he not gotten hurt, he was on pace to be a top 5 fantasy Quarterback. With two of the best receivers in the league in Alshon Jeffery and Brandon Marshall, and arguably the most explosive Running back in the Nfl in Matt Forte, Cutler has the weapons to have the best season of his career in 2014.</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "offvert">
				</div>
				<div class = "shouldnot ">
				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>The main concern with Cutler heading into 2014 is injury concern. He missed most of the 2013 season with injuries, and he has not played 16 games in any of his last four seasons. Also, when Cutler did play last season, he threw 12 interceptions compared to only 19 touchdowns. If the Bears offensive line cannot keep Cutler healthy in 2014, it will not even matter how explosive the Bears offensive weapons are.</p>

					<p> Brandin Cooks, the explosive rookie wide receiver out of Oregon State University has tremendous potential to succeed in a creative, pass-happy Saints offense this season. The saints lost their two quickest pass catchers in Darren Sproles and Lance Moore this offseason, and Brandin Cooks has the potential to fill both of their roles and then some. Cooks is best known for his speed and his elusiveness with the football, and the saints could line him up in the slot or the backfield this season. </p>

				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>The downside to drafting Cooks this season is his size and physicality. Cooks is only 5 foot 10 and 189 Pounds, and we do not know how he will adjust to taking the NFL-pounding. Also, Kenny Stills has proven himself to be a reliable number two receiver in the Saints offense, and Cooks could have trouble finding his niche in the high powered Saints offense. </p>

Also, Nicks will be surrounded by a ton of talent with Reggie Wayne, TY Hilton, and Trent Richardson. If Nicks is able to expose the one on one coverage he expects to see, he could easily become Luck&apos;s favorite down the field target, which could pay huge dividends for fantasy owners. </p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p>DeAngelo Williams had 1176 total yards in 2013, and easily led all Carolina Runningbacks in total rushes, rushing yards, and yards per carry. Williams has never averaged less than 4.1 yards per carry in a season, and with a completely depleted Panthers receiving core, Williams will find himself playing an even bigger role in Carolina&apos;s offense. Williams found himself as the RB with the 18th most rushing yards after 2013, and that number can only go up.</p>

				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>Williams turns 31 this season, and it is very difficult for a RB who has been pounded for nine seasons in the NFL to preform. His ceiling is very low, as he has not had a 1000 yard rushing season since 2009, and he also loses most of his goal line oppurtunities to Mike Tolbert. The Panther&apos;s receiving is completely depleted heading into 2014, and this means that teams will likely load up the box on Carolina, making their number one goal to stop the run. Williams will likely find himself having a very dissappointing year in 2014, and should not be considered a starting RB in most formats.</p>

					<p>Aaron Dobson was only fully healthy for 9 games last season, and in those games, he had 7 or more targets in all but three. Coming into 2014, he has seperated himself from Kenbrell Thompkins, and looks slotted as the number two receiver for Tom Brady and the Patriots. He has the potential to be an extremely dangerous deep threat, as he recorded passes of 10 yards or more in all of the games he was healthy. Julian Edelman will be the focus of the short passing game and Aaron Dobson can find himself playing the Randy Moss-type role for the Pats this season.</p>

				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>The problem with Dobson is that his role is still up in the air. The Patriots brought in an establish number two receiver in Brandon Lafell, and also have Danny Amendola still on their depth chart. Dobson&apos;s 37 receptions and 519 yards were very underwhelming, and if he is unable to stay healthy he could easily be passed in the depth chart. The patriots wide receiver corp is always crowded and at the end of the day it comes down to who Tom Brady feels the most comfortable throwing the ball to, which could easily end up being someone other than Dobson.</p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p>When the Bengals selected Jeremy Hill in the second round of this years draft, it surprised a lot of people, especially since they picked Giovani Bernard the year before and still have Benjarvus Green Ellis under contract. However, Hill is an extremely talented back. He rushed for 1940 yards and 26 touchdowns at LSU last year, and if he is able to pass the Law Firm on the depth chart, he has the potential to score a lot of red zone touchdowns. The Bengals clearly had a motive spending a second round pick on Hill, so do not be surprised if he has a nice rookie season splitting time with Gio Bernard.</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "offvert">
				</div>
				<div class = "shouldnot ">
				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>Regardless of how much Hill is able to impress the Bengals coaches, he will have an extremely difficult time passing Giovani Bernard on the Bengals depth charts. At best, he will fill the Law Firms role, which only led to 756 rushing yards a season ago. The Bengals like to have Gio on the field as a change of pace receiving back, and Hill only had 26 receptions for LSU a season ago. In PPR leagues, Hill&apos;s value goes down the drain, however he could find his way to over 8 touchdowns if hes inserted in goal line situations.</p>

					<p>Many thought Tyler Eifert would be a huge sleeper last season, however he never lived up to the Hype. With a full season under his belt, and his competition Jermaine Gresham a year older, Eifert has the oppurtunity to break away from the pack and be the Bengals number 1 Tight End. His value increases exponentially in Keeper/Dynasty leagues, as Gresham will be a free agent in 2015.  </p>

				<p>Tyler Eifert&apos;s 39 receptions, 445 receving yards, and two touchdowns were extremely dissappointing last season. His 39 receptions were the 22 most among Tight Ends, and heading into this season it will be tough for him to improve those numbers. He still has to split reps with Jermaine Gresham, who had 7 more targets and catches than Eifert in 2013. Eifert really has no reason being drafted as a TE1 this season, and his value is based solely in potential.</p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> Coming off of a great season with the Colts, Donald Brown left for the Chargers in Free agency and looks to add solid depth to their RunningBack core. He has the potential to fit in nicely alongside Ryadn Mathews and Danny Woodhead, and could play an even bigger role in the running game if Mathews goes down.</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "offvert">
				</div>
				<div class = "shouldnot ">
				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>The problem with Donald Brown is that he is playing behind Woodhead and Mathews, and he might not see the field too much this season. He looks to fill Ronnie Browns roll, who only had 8 receptions and 45 carries in 2013. It looks as though the Chargers signed Brown as insurance in case Mathews gets hurt.</p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> Tre Mason was drafted in the Third Round by the St. Louis Rams this year to be a change of pace compliment to Zac Stacy. Mason could have a lot of value as a third down or goalline back, and if anything goes wrong with Zac Stacy, expect Mason to step up and fill his role with ease.  </p>

				<div class = "offvert">
				</div>
				<div class = "shouldnot ">
				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>Tre Mason's skills do not compliment Zac Stacy's as much as most people believe. In his 2013 season at Auburn, Mason only had 11 receptions, and most people believe Stacy's major weakness lies in his role as a pass catcher. If Mason cannot seperate himself from Stacy and find his niche, he serves next to no fantasy value.</p>
