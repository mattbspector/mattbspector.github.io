					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> 2013 was a career high year for Lesean Mccoy. He set career highs with 314 carries and 1,607 rushing yards. He is also considered a king of the PPR throne, having more than 50 catches in three of the last four seasons. Shady truly benefits from a Chip Kelly run-heavy offense, and a possible 2000 yard season does not seem out of reach. Look for Mccoy to have another impressive season as he rules the one of the many PPR kingdoms.<p>
				</div>
				<div class = "offvert">
				</div>
				<div class = "shouldnot ">
				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>Having a less impressive season than his 2013 season is almost inevitable. It is extremely likely that his Rushing Yards per game will decrease, and his opportunities to catch passes from the backfield might regress as well. The Eagles brought in PPR monster Darren Sproles this offseason, and he is expected to take away some of Mccoy&apos;s reps. However, Sproles should not be the reason you do not draft McCoy. Just look for a slight regression this year compared to his 2013 campaign.</p>

					<p> You know what they say? Purple is the color or royalty. You know what they call Peterson? Purple Jesus. Peterson surprised nobody last year, averaging 90 rushing yards a game. Rumor has it that Peterson has been working on his pass-catching skills, and with Gerhart out of the picture, look for Peterson&apos;s PPR value to rise. Norv Turner also plans on using AP in a more creative way, getting him more involved in open space and in the passing the game. Peterson should definitely be looked at as a high end first round pick. </p>

				<p>There are many questions surrounding whether or not AP is going to ask to leave the Vikings this year, as he has expressed a good amount of unhappiness with the quarterback situation and may request to take his talents elsewhere. He is also close to turning 30 and past the average age of elite Running Backs. Lastly, look out for his injury risk. His body has certainly taken a toll at this point in his career, and his way of running through people makes him a likely candidate for a possible injury.</p>

He did have operations performed on his knee and finger, however, multiple reports have claimed that he looks to be at 100%. Also, Scott Linehan has left the Lions to run the Cowboys offense, so there is a chance that the Lions will not throw the pigskin as much. Not to mention, Golden Tate has joined the team and could easily gain Stafford’s trust for when there are too many defensive players hovering around Megatron. </p>

					<p> In 2013, Peyton Manning had arguably the best season for a quarterback in NFL history. He completely dominated, not just other quarterbacks, but every other player in Total Fantasy Points. He set ridiculous records, throwing for 5.477 yards and 55 touchdowns, leading the Broncos to the Super Bowl. With the addition of Emmanuel Sanders and the late season emergence of Montee Ball, things are only pointing up for Manning, who could easily be the top Fantasy Quarterback for the second straight year.  </p>

				<p>For the second straight year, Manning will be the oldest starting Quarterback in the NFL, and one can only wonder how many more great prefomances he has left in him. If he takes one bad hit he could easily be done for the year. Furthermore, Manning lost two of his top weapons in Eric Decker and Knowshon Moreno. The two of them combined for 147 catches last year and 1836 receiving yards. Those numbers will be difficult to replace and could drastically effect Manning&apos;s season. </p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> Coming out of college there were many questions surrounding Martin and if his playing style would translate well to the NFL.  As a rookie, Martin managed to silence his critics.  In his first season in the league, Martin accounted for 1,454 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns on the ground.  What makes Martin a top fantasy running back is his ability to catch the ball out of the backfield.  Along with his outstanding numbers on the ground during his rookie seasons, he also gained 472 yards and one touchdown through the air.  With the addition of Mike Evans through the draft and Vincent Jackson already on the roster, expect Martin to definitely have some room to operate.</p>

				<p>Martin wasn’t able to reproduce his rookie numbers in his second year in the league.  It seemed as if opposing defenses were keying in on Martin and weren’t allowing him to control the game.  Martin was also hampered by injuries last year, as he was forced to miss 10 games with a torn shoulder labrum.  Whoever drafts Martin better hope that the injury bug doesn’t reappear. </p>

Throughout his career, Foster has been a touchdown machine.  In 3 of his last 4 seasons, Foster has accounted for at least 10 touchdowns on the ground.  In addition to his contributions in the rushing game, Foster has also been a huge part of the Houston Texan’s aerial assault.

In week 5 Stacy proved his worth when he touched the ball 17 times and ran for 78 yards.  From week 5 to the end of the regular season, Stacy averaged just under 21 carries a game.  Unlike many other number one running backs, Stacy also happened to do a lot of his damage in the redzone.

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> Drew Brees is a fantasy King.  Year after year Brees puts up sensational numbers for the New Orleans Saints.  Ever since joining the Saints in 2006, Brees has only played one season in which he has thrown for fewer than 4,400 yards.  Not even Peyton Manning, Aaron Rodgers, or Tom Brady have been able to accomplish those insane numbers.  It is safe to assume another monster year from Brees this upcoming season with Jimmy Graham and Marques Colston returning and the addition of first round pick Brandin Cooks. </p>

				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>One argument could be made that with the departure of Darren Sproles through free agency, Brees has lost his favorite check down receiver, which in turn could reduce his production.  Another possible downside is that Brees is sometimes prone to throwing interceptions.  The last four seasons, Brees has thrown a total of 67 interceptions.  </p>

					<p> Dez Bryant is one of the most skilled wide receivers in the entire NFL.  There is nothing that he can’t do as a receiver.  Time and time again Bryant has proven he&apos;s capable of leaping over defenders for long receptions as well as taking short passes all the way to the house.  Bryant put up huge numbers last season but it’s very reasonable to predict better numbers this year with the addition of Scott Linehan as offensive coordinator.  Linehan&apos;s number one receivers have put up outstanding numbers in the past so let’s Dez Bryant can do the same. </p>

					<p> Le&apos;Veon Bell had a very solid but not overwhelming rookie season.  As the season progressed, Bell became much more involved in the Pittsburgh Steelers offense.  Along with being a productive back on the ground, Bell is one of the better pass-catching running backs in the league.  With a quarterback like Ben Roethlisberger who likes to scramble out of the pocket and check the ball down, Bell could prove to be a very worthwhile selection in PPR leagues. </p>

				<p>Over the offseason, the Steelers made some moves that should make Le&apos;Veon Bell fans a little curious.  Pittsburgh spent some money in free agency to bring in LeGarrette Blount as well as used a third round draft pick on Kent State running back Dri Archer.  With many mouths to feed in the Pittsburgh backfield, Le&apos;veon Bell could see a reduction in his workload.  Another worry is that early in his NFL career, Bell has already fought through concussion issues, which is always a red flag for fantasy owners.</p>

					<p> After an amazing Rookie campaign, Trent Richardson dissappointed all of his fantasy owners in a dissappointing Sophomore Season. However, after being traded to Indianapolis Trent played the remainder of the season with a broken shoulder. Not only that, but Richardson admitted that he was unable to fully grasp the Colt&apos; complex offense in half a season. Now that he has had an entire year to get more comfortable with the Colts offense, and fully healed, look for Richardson to return to his Rookie Form. </p>

				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>In 2013, Richardson was flat out awful. He had only 563 rushing yards and three touchdowns, resulting in him being labeled as one of the biggest busts of the year. The most concerning aspect of Richardson&apos;s campaign with the Colts was that towards the end of the season he lost the majority of offensive snaps to Donald Brown. Fantasy Owners beware, the colts backfield has the potential to be a committee, with Richardson receiving even less snaps than Brown.</p>

His growing chemistry with Alex Smith makes him a likely candidate to lead all backs in total fantasy points. There is absolutely no reason that Jamaal Charles should be available after the second pick in the draft. Oh, and one last thing. Last year he scored a total of 19 touchdowns! I repeat: 19 touchdowns! </p>

There is absolutely no reason that Jamaal Charles should be available after the second pick in the draft. Oh, and one last thing. Last year he scored a total of 19 touchdowns!

					<p> If anybody deserves to rule a kingdom and rightfully wear a crown on his head, it is Jamaal Charles, as he is the center piece of the Chiefs offense. His growing chemistry with Alex Smith makes him a likely candidate to lead all backs in total fantasy points. There is absolutely no reason that Jamaal Charles should be available after the second pick in the draft. Oh, and one last thing. Last year he scored a total of 19 touchdowns! I repeat: 19 touchdowns! </p>

				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>Knile Davis was beyond impressive when he filled in forJamaal late in the season last year. Andy Reid expects Davis&apos; workload to increase this season. Should this effect your view on Jamaal Charles? Potentially. But more realistically, Davis should serve as a potential handcuff in later rounds.</p>
