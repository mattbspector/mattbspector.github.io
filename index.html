					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> 2013 was a career high year for Lesean Mccoy. He set career highs with 314 carries and 1,607 rushing yards. He is also considered a king of the PPR throne, having more than 50 catches in three of the last four seasons. Shady truly benefits from a Chip Kelly run-heavy offense, and a possible 2000 yard season does not seem out of reach. Look for Mccoy to have another impressive season as he rules the one of the many PPR kingdoms.<p>
				</div>
				<div class = "offvert">
				</div>
				<div class = "shouldnot ">
				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>Having a less impressive season than his 2013 season is almost inevitable. It is extremely likely that his Rushing Yards per game will decrease, and his opportunities to catch passes from the backfield might regress as well. The Eagles brought in PPR monster Darren Sproles this offseason, and he is expected to take away some of Mccoy&apos;s reps. However, Sproles should not be the reason you do not draft McCoy. Just look for a slight regression this year compared to his 2013 campaign.</p>

					<p> You know what they say? Purple is the color or royalty. You know what they call Peterson? Purple Jesus. Peterson surprised nobody last year, averaging 90 rushing yards a game. Rumor has it that Peterson has been working on his pass-catching skills, and with Gerhart out of the picture, look for Peterson&apos;s PPR value to rise. Norv Turner also plans on using AP in a more creative way, getting him more involved in open space and in the passing the game. Peterson should definitely be looked at as a high end first round pick. </p>

				<p>There are many questions surrounding whether or not AP is going to ask to leave the Vikings this year, as he has expressed a good amount of unhappiness with the quarterback situation and may request to take his talents elsewhere. He is also close to turning 30 and past the average age of elite Running Backs. Lastly, look out for his injury risk. His body has certainly taken a toll at this point in his career, and his way of running through people makes him a likely candidate for a possible injury.</p>

					<p> There is no better receiver in the NFL. It’s just that simple. He played 14 games last year and still managed to rake in 84 receptions for 1,492 yards and 12 touchdowns. The point is that year after year, Megatron proves that he is the best receiver in the NFL.  Also, Golden Tate and Eric Ebron should help Calvin play against more single coverage this year, which Calvin will easily exploit  </p>

				<p>There are very few, and I mean VERY few reasons why you shouldn’t take Calvin Johnson. He did have operations performed on his knee and finger, however, multiple reports have claimed that he looks to be at 100%. Also, Scott Linehan has left the Lions to run the Cowboys offense, so there is a chance that the Lions will not throw the pigskin as much. Not to mention, Golden Tate has joined the team and could easily gain Stafford’s trust for when there are too many defensive players hovering around Megatron. </p>

					<p> If anybody deserves to rule a kingdom and rightfully wear a crown on his head, it is Jamaal Charles, as he is the center piece of the Chiefs offense. His growing chemistry with Alex Smith makes him a likely candidate to lead all backs in total fantasy points. There is absolutely no reason that Jamaal Charles should be available after the second pick in the draft. Oh, and one last thing. Last year he scored a total of 19 touchdowns! I repeat: 19 touchdowns! </p>

				<p>Forte has had serious injury concerns in the past, and after another year of playing in the NFL, his chances of re-injury are higher. Also, The Chicago Bears offense now features two elite receivers in Brandon Marshall and Alshon Jeffery. Although this did not affect Forte&apos;s performance a season ago, there is potential that the Bears will focus on getting the ball to their two standout wideouts more often. </p>

					<p>Aaron Rodgers has a skillset unlike any other quarterback in the NFL.  Rodgers pairs elite accuracy and arm strength with a superb running ability.  Although he missed some time last year with a collarbone injury, Rodgers managed to throw for at least 240 yards and a touchdown in every game he started.  With the emergence of Eddie Lacy as an offensive threat, expect Rodgers to have more room to operate and shred opposing defenses. </p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> A.J. Green is simply a freak athlete.  Not only does he stand 6’4, but also has a wing span over 6 and a half feet and has an outstanding leaping ability.  Green consistently uses his size and speed to devastate defenses.  Only four years into his young NFL career, Green has already become a top 5 wide receiver and arguably the most dangerous deep threat in the game.  In 2013, A.J. Green was targeted an NFL high 178 times and hauled in 98 of those passes.</p>

				<div class = "shouldnot ">
				<h1>Why You Should Not Draft Him</h1>
				<p>If it weren’t for a sub par quarterback, A.J. Green would undoubtedly be a top 3 fantasy wide receiver this upcoming season.  Many people question if Andy Dalton is capable of carrying the Cincinnati offense.  Without a trustworthy quarterback, drafting A.J. Green amongst the top 5 receivers could prove to be a mistake.  In addition to a shaky quarterback situation, the Bengals schedule doesn&apos;t favor Green, who will have to face Joe Haden (twice) and Darrelle Revis over the course of the season.</p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> If anybody deserves to rule a kingdom and rightfully wear a crown on his head, it is Jamaal Charles, as he is the center piece of the Chiefs offense. His growing chemistry with Alex Smith makes him a likely candidate to lead all backs in total fantasy points. There is absolutely no reason that Jamaal Charles should be available after the second pick in the draft. Oh, and one last thing. Last year he scored a total of 19 touchdowns! I repeat: 19 touchdowns! </p>

					<h1>Why You Should Draft Him</h1>
					<p> If anybody deserves to rule a kingdom and rightfully wear a crown on his head, it is Jamaal Charles, as he is the center piece of the Chiefs offense. His growing chemistry with Alex Smith makes him a likely candidate to lead all backs in total fantasy points. There is absolutely no reason that Jamaal Charles should be available after the second pick in the draft. Oh, and one last thing. Last year he scored a total of 19 touchdowns! I repeat: 19 touchdowns! </p>
